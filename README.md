# 📊 Decision Analysis Projects – Optimization & Decision-Making

This repository contains two analytical projects completed for the **Decision Analysis** course at Gdańsk University of Technology. Both projects are based on original, self-invented case studies and utilize quantitative decision-making methods such as **linear programming**, **binary optimization**, and **decision trees under risk and uncertainty**.

## 📦 Project 1: Bakery Optimization

### 🎯 Goal
To optimize production and investment decisions for a local bakery to **maximize profit** using:
- 📈 **Continuous Linear Programming**
- 🧮 **Binary Integer Programming**

### 🥐 Case 1 – Production Optimization
- 5 products: Bread, Pastry, Cake, Kremówki, Eklerki  
- Constraints: labor hours, oven time, ingredient supply  
- Objective: maximize profit under production bounds  
- Solved using Excel Solver with the Simplex LP method

### 🏗️ Case 2 – Investment Decision
- 6 investment options (e.g., marketing, new tech, training)
- Binary choices constrained by a $450K budget and strategy rules
- Goal: maximize Return on Investment (ROI)
- Solved with binary linear programming in Excel

### 📈 Insights
- Resource constraints identified as binding
- Shadow prices and reduced costs used for sensitivity analysis
- Final strategy uses full budget to invest in high-ROI areas

## 🧠 Project 2: Strategic Decisions Under Risk

### 💊 Case 1 – Drug Development Decision Tree
A pharmaceutical firm must decide whether to develop a new drug across three risky stages:
- Animal Trials → Human Trials → Market Launch  
- Probabilities and payoffs modeled in a **decision tree**
- Strategy chosen based on **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)**

#### Key Takeaways:
- Abort early after failure minimizes losses
- Market launch is only profitable after full trial success
- Demonstrates ethical and financial trade-offs

### ₿ Case 2 – Cryptocurrency Investment Under Uncertainty

Decision between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana under:
- Bull, Neutral, and Bear market conditions

🔢 Methods Applied:
- Maximax, Maximin, Laplace, Hurwicz, Savage  
- EMV (Expected Monetary Value) & EOL (Expected Opportunity Loss)

✅ Final Choice: **Bitcoin** – consistently optimal across risk methods

## 🧮 Tools & Techniques

- **Excel Solver** – Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis  
- **Decision Trees & Payoff Tables** – Risk Evaluation  
- **EMV, EOL, EVPI** – Quantitative Decision Theory  
- Visualizations and step-by-step reasoning for each decision path
